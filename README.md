# skills-konnect-ui-on-call-summary

A Claude Code agent skill that drafts and creates the team's standard weekly on-call summary notebook for any Konnect UI microfrontend (gateway-manager, mesh-manager, ai-manager, etc.) using Datadog RUM data.

Distributed via the [`skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) CLI.

## What it does

When invoked, the skill:

1. Identifies the target MFE and reporting window from your request.
2. Queries Datadog RUM via `pup` to aggregate errors and pull representative sessions.
3. Checks for incidents that intersect the window.
4. Drafts the report in the team's three-section format (Incidents / Errors / CI), with DD deep links for each error category.
5. **Previews the draft to you** and asks for confirmation.
6. Only after you approve, creates the notebook in Datadog and returns the URL.

## Prerequisites

### 1. `pup` CLI

This skill relies entirely on `pup` (Kong's Datadog CLI) for both reading RUM data and writing the notebook.

Install per the [agent-skills setup guide](https://github.com/datadog-labs/agent-skills/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-pup), then authenticate:

```bash
pup auth login
pup auth status   # confirm: ✅ Authenticated for site: datadoghq.com
```

OAuth tokens last ~1 hour. If a command fails with 401/403 mid-run, refresh:

```bash
pup auth refresh
```

The OAuth scopes needed by this skill (all included in the default scope set granted by `pup auth login`):

- `rum_apps_read`
- `notebooks_read`, `notebooks_write`
- `incident_read`

### 2. Python 3

The skill pipes JSON through small `python3` snippets to extract fields. macOS and most Linux dev machines ship with this; no additional packages required.

### 3. Access to Konnect's Datadog org

The skill targets the konnect-ui RUM application (`6e430333-9e0f-4d6b-ac63-5f7d4ad9a641`) under the Kong production Datadog org. You need an account with read access to this org's RUM data and notebooks.

### 4. Claude Code

You need [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed. The skill is loaded from `~/.claude/skills/` (user-global) or `.claude/skills/` (project-local).

## Installation

Use the [`skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) CLI to install. The package handles fetching the repo and placing `SKILL.md` in the right location for Claude Code to pick it up.

### From git (recommended)

```bash
# User-global (available across all projects)
npx skills add 2eha0/konnect-ui-on-call-summary-skill -g

# Project-local
npx skills add 2eha0/konnect-ui-on-call-summary-skill
```

### Verify

```bash
# SKILL.md is in place
ls ~/.claude/skills/konnect-ui-on-call-summary/SKILL.md

# The helper script runs and shows its CLI
python3 ~/.claude/skills/konnect-ui-on-call-summary/scripts/oncall.py --help
```

Restart Claude Code (or open a new session) so the skill is discovered. Confirm by asking Claude to list available skills, or by triggering it (see Usage below).

### Uninstall

```bash
npx skills remove konnect-ui-on-call-summary -g
```

## Usage

Trigger the skill with plain language. Examples:

- `帮我写一份上周 gateway-manager 的 on-call 周报`
- `Generate the weekly on-call summary for mesh-manager`
- `Write last week's RUM error report for ai-manager`
- `Draft the on-call notebook for gateway-manager covering Apr 28 – May 4`

Claude will:

1. Run the helper script (one bash call): `python3 ~/.claude/skills/konnect-ui-on-call-summary/scripts/oncall.py collect --mfe <name>`. The script does all the pup queries internally.
2. **Print the full draft markdown to you, verbatim.**
3. Ask: _"Want me to create the notebook in Datadog?"_

Reply with confirmation (`yes`, `好的`, `创建吧`, `go ahead`, …) and a second bash call (`oncall.py create …`) creates the notebook and prints the URL. Reply with edits (`add a CI section about flaky test X`, `drop the 404 entry`, …) and the draft is updated before re-asking.

If you want to skip the preview and create immediately, say so explicitly: _"create it without previewing."_ (Default behavior is always preview-first.)

### Manual usage (without Claude)

The helper script is a normal CLI; you can run it directly:

```bash
# Draft markdown for last week of gateway-manager
python3 ~/.claude/skills/konnect-ui-on-call-summary/scripts/oncall.py collect \
  --mfe gateway-manager > /tmp/draft.md

# Edit /tmp/draft.md, then create the notebook
python3 ~/.claude/skills/konnect-ui-on-call-summary/scripts/oncall.py create \
  --mfe gateway-manager --week-of 2026-04-27 --markdown-file /tmp/draft.md
```

## What's in the report

The format is fixed by `scripts/oncall.py` — every report has the same three sections in the same order:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Incidents** | Datadog incidents created during the window. Empty section says `No incidents affecting <MFE> in this period.` |
| **Errors** | One subsection per **noteworthy** RUM error category — real bugs, performance issues, build/CSP problems. Each has a DD deep link (2-minute window around a representative event) and one canned line: `<N> occurrences. <fixed wording>`. |
| **CI** | Defaults to `No CI issues observed during this week. Failed tests all passed on reruns.` Extend by editing the markdown during preview. |

The default view is **focused** — matches the team's existing on-call notebooks at 3–6 categories. Routine errors (401 session timeouts, 403 permission denials, 404 stale links, navigation cancels) are tagged `noteworthy: False` and folded into a single footnote: `<!-- N additional event(s) across M expected/low-signal categories hidden — re-run with --all to include them. -->`. Pure noise (chrome-extension errors, `Unable to preload CSS`, browser intervention warnings, ResizeObserver loops) is dropped before classification.

To see the full breakdown, pass `--all`. To tune the threshold for low-volume unrecognized errors, pass `--min-unknown-count N` (default 3).

The full pattern list lives in `scripts/oncall.py`'s `PATTERNS`. Each entry has a `regex`, fixed `title`, fixed `wording`, and `noteworthy: bool`. First match wins.

## Customization

To change patterns, descriptions, MFE display names, or the report skeleton, edit `skills/konnect-ui-on-call-summary/scripts/oncall.py`:

- **Add or refine a category** — append to `PATTERNS`. Set `noteworthy: True` if it should always show, `False` if it's expected/routine. Order matters; place specific regexes before generic ones.
- **Drop a noise pattern** — append to `NOISE`. Anything matching is excluded entirely.
- **Promote an existing routine pattern** — flip `noteworthy: False → True` on the entry (e.g., if 404s suddenly become a real concern for your team).
- **Override an MFE's display name** — extend `MFE_DISPLAY` (used in titles and notebook names).
- **Change the report skeleton** — edit `cmd_collect` (the function that prints the markdown).
- **Use a different RUM app** — pass `--app-id <UUID>` at the CLI, or change `KONNECT_UI_APP_ID`.

The trigger phrases (which determine when Claude activates the skill) live in `SKILL.md`'s `description` field — edit there to add team-specific terms ("incident review", "RUM digest", …).

## Limitations

- **Aggregation key is exact `@error.message`.** Errors that include resource IDs in the message (e.g., `… for <uuid> …`) become many distinct buckets. The script still classifies each bucket via regex and merges them under a shared category, but the per-bucket count appears once per merged category.
- **DD deep links land on a time range, not a specific event.** The link uses a 2-minute window around the representative event because pup doesn't expose the encoded `event=` token. Reviewers click through and see the matching events listed in the side panel.
- **No CI integration.** The skill always emits the "No CI issues observed" placeholder. If your team has a different default or a CI source to query, edit `cmd_collect` or extend the skill.
- **Konnect-ui is the default RUM app.** For MFEs in other apps (admin-konnect-ui, portal-nuxt, kong-manager-oss, …), pass `--app-id`.

## Troubleshooting

**`pup auth failed. Run pup auth refresh…`** — your token expired. Run `pup auth refresh`; if that also fails, `pup auth login` (interactive browser flow). Then re-run the collect step.

**Empty Errors section** — `service:<MFE>` matched no error events in the window. Confirm the MFE name (the `service` tag in RUM is usually identical to the MFE name) and try `--app-id` if it's not under konnect-ui.

**`### IDs: [` or other malformed-looking titles** — those are real "unknown" buckets the script couldn't classify. Edit them away during preview, or add a regex to `PATTERNS` / `NOISE` if they should be auto-handled going forward.

**Skill doesn't activate on your phrase** — the skill triggers on "on-call summary", "周报", "weekly report", and MFE names. If your team uses different terms, edit the `description` in `SKILL.md`.

**`pup notebooks create` fails with `missing field time`** — the helper script always writes `time: {live_span: 1w}`. If you see this, you're likely calling pup directly from a custom payload — copy the payload structure from `cmd_create`.
